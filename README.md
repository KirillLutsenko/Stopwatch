**Tasks:** 

Implement a stopwatch that counts time in the "HH: MM: SS" format

The stopwatch must have the following buttons:

- "Start / Stop" - start / stop timing, stops and resets the stopwatch value.

- "Wait" - works on a double click (the time between clicks is not more than 300 ms!) The stopwatch must stop timing; if you press start after it, then the countdown is resumed.

- "Reset" - reset the stopwatch to 0. Resets the stopwatch and starts counting again.

P.S .: 300 mls is not a DoubleClick
